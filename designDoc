FE

simple web page served by nginx, GETs last dates for Loki and Pan from BE. 

On load, get data. update state. 

Element shows last date for Loki
Form POSTs current time to DB and reloads. 
Element shows last date for Pan
Form POSTs current time to DB and reloads. 

Basic setup
Centered
Picture of LokiSlugBear
last date seen: blah
Form with button

picute of Pan
last date seen: blah
Form with Button


So, we're going to make a cat element to show the pic, the last date seen, the form with button.
Pull from an array of cat names. 
Picture will be based on the cat name. 

Need to set up state after the array, pull data from DB to fill up state, will create elements from changed state. NO, that will pull data from cat that doesn't need it. Also, forms will reload page, pulling all data again, even if it doesn't need it. Don't do that. 

So use buttons. 
set up state.
Create elements from array of cat names. 
each element will pull from DB
each element will update state on successful write to DB, which will update THAT element, and not reload the page and cause unneeded DB pulls and element refreshes. 


BE

Simple express setup that takes in GET from FE, gets data from redis database, formats, and hands it back to FE. 
No. Can do in FE. No need to make a whole extra BE for this. 
Yes. Keep functionality modular. Easier to TS. Let's do Yes. 


Data

{LokiSlugBear: date and time}
{Pan: date and time}
